# Networking module

This module provides the networking glue between the sibling [executors](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcegraph/executors/google/0.0.28/submodules/executors) and [docker-mirror](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcegraph/executors/google/0.0.28/submodules/docker-mirror) modules.

This module is very simple, creating only a network and a subnet.
